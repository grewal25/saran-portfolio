            <h3>why smart people should vote</h3>
      <p>
        Generally in a democratic country, voting turns out to remain in 50-60%
        of the range. In some cases, it can go upto 70-80% but that’s very rare.
        Now, that makes me very curious. Who doesn’t vote and why? I think one
        of the reasons people vote is to make their candidate win and majority
        of people who don’t vote are those who either can’t vote and a small
        minority chooses not to vote. And if you ask them why they don’t vote,
        they may reply
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Candidates are not good</li>
        <li>
          <li>Voting doesn’t change anything</li>
        </li>
        <li>Have no time for politics</li>
        <li>Believe in totalitarianism</li>
      </ul> 

      <p>
        50% of voting turn over is scary. It means less and less people are
        believing in the democratic systems and people living in western
        democracies have no idea what it looks like to live in a “non-democratic
        country”. More and more people opting out of voting will cause people to
        reduce trust in the democracy and nobody wants to see how a
        non-democratic country works nor they want to live in that country.

      <h4>So, how can we improve that?</h4>
