        <p className="text-lg pt-2 italic">Self-help is not bad, commercialization of it, is!</p>

         <p className="text-md pt-2">All the cliché headlines and cliché essays. You read like 10 of these and still, your life has not improved much. What did go wrong? Why in 99% of cases this advice won’t work?.</p>
         <p className="text-md pt-2">I think with the rise of social media and the attention economy, real self-help is lost somewhere. I am not against self-help but commercialization of it certainly diminished the ROI. More and more people are joining the online army of content creation and as content is a king now, quality has decreased with the rise of quantity.</p>
         <p className="text-md pt-2">Previously it was well-studied professors, academics or psychologists write about the mental health of people. Internet is egalitarian in nature. Only the best can reach the top. However, how come real psychologists merely get 100 views on their article, and some dude living in Philipines can just write about some mental tricks and get maybe a million views?</p>
         <p className="text-md pt-2">When it all comes to views, we actually compromised with the truth ( or reality ). A person who looks happy all the time on their video may have a miserable life. Overall happiness is decreasing as the wealth of nations growing.</p>
         <p className="text-md pt-2">Another reason is maybe due to rising in competition as more people putting content online and how can a company like YouTube, Instagram, or Medium decide what to show to whom? There comes the second face of the coin.</p>

        <p className="text-lg font-bold py-4">Real Self-help</p>
        <p className="text-md pt-2">The real self-help books are written around 2000 thousand years ago. We extrapolate the lesson of the past to our current experience and called it new ideas. We humans are limited in capabilities, insecure and greedy ever since we went out of Savana. If you are not familiar with Stoicism, you are missing a lot of opportunities for growth in your life. Stoicism is not the only school of life, there are many, however, this is the one that fits most with my view of the world. Your task is to find your school.</p>
        <p className="text-md pt-2">These are the links I would recommend you to follow if you are curious about Stoicism:</p>

        <p className="text-lg font-bold py-4">Ditch the social media</p>
        <p className="text-md pt-2">Find blogs of individuals on the internet rather than depending on IG/Twitter feed to recommend from your self-help guru. There are many people who write on a variety of different topics and these topics can really help to improve your mental wellbeing. You can follow these people to read great content:</p>
