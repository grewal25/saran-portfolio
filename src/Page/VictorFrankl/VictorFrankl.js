          If anyone asks you to pick an option from the two situations below,
          which one would you pick?
        </p>

        <p className="text-xl pt-8 font-sans antialiased">
          You are young but poor You are old but rich
        </p>

        <p className="text-xl pt-8 font-sans antialiased">
          I bet you would pick the option first.
        </p>

        <p className="text-xl pt-8 font-sans antialiased">
          I may have also picked the first until I read a passage from Victor
          Frankl's book, Man search for meaning. Victor Frankl had a tragic life
          wherein his mid-20s he was sent to a concentration camp in Poland
          along with his wife and parents and he lost them all in there and
          himself was saved by US troops in the summer of 1945.
        </p>

        <p className="text-xl pt-8 font-sans antialiased">
          He continued his practice in psychology after being freed from the
          camp and wrote his experience in his book and wrote intensively on
          Logotherapy (Logos is a Greek word which denotes “meaning”).
        </p>

        <p className="text-xl pt-8 font-sans antialiased">
          Victor Frankl put the argument against pop culture which puts the
          young and shines on the top and kind of forgets about the old and the
          ancients. He argues that even though an old person might not have
          years to live, they always have the realities they realised, the
          potentialities they worked hard for, and actualized and fulfilled the
          meaning of their life.
        </p>

        <p className="text-xl pt-8 font-sans antialiased">
          The most powerful thing they have is that no one can ever take their
          experience and hardship back from them, no one can take back their
          failures and successes, they will own it forever and this is what a
          young person lacks.
        </p>

        <p className="text-xl pt-8 font-sans antialiased">
          Victor Frankl’s point hit me on any level, emotionally it gives a new
          viewpoint on ageing. In our society ageing is treated as something
          which is undesirable. We are afraid of the 30s or 40s, we don't think
          of them as milestones but as burdens, rather than celebrating the
          challenges we passed through, we hide in the corner of our emotions
          and reject the struggle we had put over the last 30 or 40 years to
          achieve the milestones which we have taken for granted.
        </p>

        <p className="text-xl pt-8 font-sans antialiased pb-48">
          I would recommend reading his book and he wrote his whole book on the
          premise of “meaning”. From his horrific experience as a prisoner in
          the camp, he still thinks meaning can be found in the dimmest moments
          of life.
