            Writer’s block is real, procrastination is real too. For most days,
            I think I do alright and don’t need to push myself to start my work,
            whether it's coding or reading a book, or writing a blog post.
            Nevertheless, I do need some internal push some days when I don’t
            feel like writing or fixing my code.

            This technique does two things, it gives me the smallest possible
            goal for myself of the day and second, it worked against the initial
            inertia that didn’t allow me to focus and start working. As Newton
            said, “it requires an external force to stop a body in the motion OR
            we need some external force to move the body if it is in the rest
            state”. After 15 minutes, I can guarantee you that you will not stop
            working because now you are in the opposite mode, it requires some
            force to stop you!{" "}
          </p>

          <p className="text-xl pt-8 font-sans antialiased">
            To boost up the process, you can make yourself a cup of tea or
            coffee and nearly all the time, I stick to work and sometimes work
            more than the good days.
          </p>

          <p className="text-xl pt-8 font-sans antialiased">
            This simple technique can be used to do other things too, maybe you
            want to go to the gym but don’t feel like it, maybe you can say to
            yourself that you will only do cardio for 15 mins and I will call it
            a day. Keeping things simple will relax your mind and you can get
            more things done.

            This plan may look easy and simple ( which it actually is), but it
            is very effective. My whole philosophy of work is it shouldn’t feel
            like work for most days, you will have some days where work will
            feel like work, but by overcoming those days, you can have a stable
            and fulfilled work life.
