# quiting social media: experiment

I am quiting social media today. All togethor. The things I can quit, will be quit. For instance, Facebook, Instagram, will be gone today. Others like Whatsapp will not because I don't spend much time there and only way for me to talk to my family. I never started Tik-tok, it looks lame since very starting and found no reason to start it, so that ship has alrady sailed. I am not going to quit YouTube yet, however, I am going to restrict it.

### But, why to quit? 


### beyong nihilism

Everthing is going to end and we will just die one day. All morality and preachers of 
it can't stand the blow of this logic.
